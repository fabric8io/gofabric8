## Service for initializing the tenant services in DSaas

Tips to running unit tests - this command seems to work on OS X:

```
make clean && make && make deps && glide update && make test-unit
```

### Rapid development on Minikube / Minishift

If you run fabric8 in minikube or minishift then you can get rapid feedback of your code via the following:

 * run the app using the `:dev` docker image label:

```
git clone https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-platform.git
cd fabric8-platform
cd apps/init-tenant
mvn fabric8:deploy  -Pdev
```

* use the `kube-redeploy` make target whenever you want to create a new docker image and redeploy
```
make kube-redeploy
```
if the docker build fails you may need to type this first to point your local shell at the docker daemon inside minishift/minikube:
```
eval $(minishift docker-env)
```
