[[introduction]]
=== Introduction

To start developing on Windows you must:

* <<install-git>>
* <<install-mercurial>>
* <<install-glide>>
* <<install-go>>
* <<install-cygwin>>

After that you have to configure various things

* <<configure-git>>
* <<configure-windows-env>>

As a final step we install a debugger. This requires some preparation and that's why we do it as one of the last steps.

* <<install-delve>>

To get the code and build it, look here:

* <<get-the-code>>
* <<fetch-dependencies>>
* <<build-from-source>>

[[install-git]]

1. Make sure the box *Add the installation path to the search path* is checked.
1. Click *Finish* when you are done.

[[install-glide]]
=== Install Glide

In Go third-party packages are typically searched for inside a special directory. If a required package is not there, it will be downloaded using link:https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Download_and_install_packages_and_dependencies[`go get`]. While this seems handy at first it can have a serious drawback: you cannot specify which version of the package to download. This can lead to problems when a required package changes its interface that your code relies on.
To overcome this , we use a tool called link:https://glide.sh/[`glide`] to download required packages in exactly specified versions and install them in a `vendor` directory right next to our source code under.

1. Browse to the link:https://github.com/Masterminds/glide/releases/[Glide release download page].
1. Under *Release 0.11.1* (or newer) click on the link that says: *glide-v0.11.1-windows-amd64.zip*. (e.g. link:https://github.com/Masterminds/glide/releases/download/v0.11.1/glide-v0.11.1-windows-amd64.zip[download Glide 0.11.1])
1. Windows prompts you to save the file to your machine. The exact location isn't important.
1. Right click the downloaded file and select *extract all*.
1. Enter `c:\Users\YOURNAME\glide` as destination and replace `YOURNAME` with your winows login name.
1. Click extract.
1. The `glide.exe` binary is now located under `C:\Users\YOURNAME\glide\windows-amd64\glide.exe`

[[install-go]]
=== Install Go

1. Browse to the link:https://golang.org/dl/[Go download page].
1. Under *Featured downloads* click on the one that says: *Microsoft Windows*. (e.g. link:https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.7.4.windows-amd64.msi[download Go 1.7.4])
1. Windows prompts you to save the file to your machine. The exact location isn't important.
1. Run the saved file.
1. The system displays the Go Setup Wizard.
1. Click the *Next* button to move through the wizard and accept all the defaults.
1. Click *Install* to install Go.
1. Click *Finish* when you are done.

[[install-cygwin]]
=== Install Cygwin

Cygwin is: 

* a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.
* a DLL (cygwin1.dll) which provides substantial POSIX API functionality.

Follow these steps to install cygwin:

1. Browse to the link:https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe[Cygwin download page].
1. Windows prompts you to save the file to your machine. The exact location isn't important.
1. Run the saved file.
1. The system displays the Go Setup Wizard.
1. Click the *Next* button once to get to the page *Choose A Download Source*.
1. Select *Install from Internet* (if not already selected).
1. Click *Next* to get to the page *Select Root Installation Directory*.
1. Enter `C:\Users\YOURNAME\cygwin` as *Root Directory* and replace `YOURNAME` with your Windows username. 
1. Under *Install for* select *All users* (if not already selected).
1. Click *Next* to get to the page *Select Local Package Directory*.
1. Enter `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Local\Temp` as *Local Package Directory* and replace `YOURNAME` with your Windows username.
1. Click *Next* to get to the page *Select Your Internet Connection*.
1. Select *Direct Connection* (if not already selected). If you have a more exotic connection (like in a univeristy or school), you might need to adjust proxy setting here but in most cases this is not needed.
1. Click *Next* to get to the page *Choose A Download Site*.
1. If you don't have an extremly slow internet connection you can leave everything untouched. Otherwise you can pick an *Available Download Site* that's more close to you than the default `http://cygwin.mirror.constant.com`.
1. Click *Next* to get to the *Select Packages Page*.
1. In the *Search* field enter `make` to filter the packages.
1. Unfold the *Devel* section by clicking on the little `+` symbol.
1. In the *Package* column look for *make: The GNU version of the 'make' utility* and click the *Skip* text in the *New* column. This should render the *Bin?* column on this line to be a checked box. The *Skip* text should also disappear and instead render a version string like `4.2.1-1`.
1. Click *Next* to get to the page *Resolving Dependencies* page.
1. Click *Next* to download and install the packages.
1. Click *Finish* when you are done.

[[configure-git]]
== Configure Git

Whenever you make a commit using Git, you want to make sure that it's clear who the author is. To address this, follow these easy steps:

1. Hit the kbd:[Windows] key on your keyboard and type `git bash` to start searching for the *Git Bash* application.
2. Hit kbd:[Enter].
3. Set your username by entering
+
[source,bash]
----
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
----
+
after the `$` character and replace `YOUR NAME` with your own name.
4. Set your email address by entering
+
[source,bash]
----
git config --global user.email "YOUR@NAME.COM"
----
+
after the `$` character and replace `YOUR@NAME.COM` with your own email address.
5. You can close the git bash now by either clicking the X or typing kbd:[Ctrl+d].

[[configure-windows-env]]
== Configure Windows environment variables

[[add-glide-to-poath]]
=== Add glide to PATH

IMPORTANT: Before you continue, *close any existing Windows Command Prompt* (or at least close the one you've opened while working through this document). This is important because otherwise the environment variables that we have modified won't be available.

To be able to launch `glide.exe` from any location using the Windows Command Prompt we'll have to add the path to the executable, namely `C:\Users\YOURNAME\glide\windows-amd64` to the Windows user's `PATH` variable or create a new `PATH` variable.

1. Hit the kbd:[Windows] key on your keyboard and type `cmd.exe` to start searching for the Windows Command Prompt. Hit kbd:[Enter].
2. We will add the path to `glide.exe` to an environment variable called `PATH` now or created it if it doesn't already exist. Check if your user already has set a `PATH` variable by typing
+
----
echo %PATH%
----
+
and hit kbd:[Enter].

 a. If the output is `%PATH%` then you have not yet set a `PATH` variable and we can continue by typing
+
----
setx PATH "%HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%\glide\windows-amd64"
----
+
and hit kbd:[Enter].

 b. If the output is something different from `%PATH%` then we have to append the path `C:\Users\YOURNAME\glide\windows-amd64` by setting the `PATH` variable and separating the already existing paths using a semicolon:
+
----
setx PATH "%PATH%;%HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%\glide\windows-amd64"
----

[[create-gopath]]
=== Create GOPATH

IMPORTANT: Before you continue, *close any existing Windows Command Prompt* (or at least close the one you've opened while working through this document). This is important because otherwise the environment variables that we have modified won't be available.

Typically, Go projects are checked out under a special directory which is commonly known as `GOPATH`. The fabric8-wit project makes not exception here. In most of the documentation that is written for Linux or MacOSX you will find us referencing this path as `$GOPATH`. On Windows this translates to `%GOPATH%`.

Now you may already have guessed this but `%GOPATH%` is also an environment variable that contains a path (sometimes a list of paths separated by semicolons) to various locations that will all be treated as `GOPATH`s by Go. 

Depending on your configuration we will either have to create a `GOPATH` environment variable or re-use an existing one.

1. Hit the kbd:[Windows] key on your keyboard and type `cmd.exe` to start searching for the Windows Command Prompt. Hit kbd:[Enter].
1. Check if your user already has set a `GOPATH` variable by typing
+
----
echo %GOPATH%
----

 a. If the output is `%GOPATH%` then you have not yet set a `GOPATH` variable and we can continue by typing
+
----
setx GOPATH "%HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%\go"
----
+
The variable `%HOMEPATH%` expands to your user's directory (e.g. `\Users\John`) and `%HOMEDRIVE%` expands to `c:` for example.

 a. If the output is something different from `%GOPATH%` then we have to append the path `%HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%\go` by setting the `GOPATH` variable and separating the already existing paths using a semicolon:
+
----
setx GOPATH "%GOPATH%;%HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%\go"
----

=== Add GOPATH\bin to PATH

IMPORTANT: Before you continue, *close any existing Windows Command Prompt* (or at least close the one you've opened while working through this document). This is important because otherwise the environment variables that we have modified won't be available.

When you fetch go packages using link:https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Download_and_install_packages_and_dependencies[`go get`] you might end up having executables from these packages living under your `%GOPATH%` in a `bin` folder. It is common to add this directory to your `%PATH%` variable like we did in <<add-glide-to-path>>.

1. Hit the kbd:[Windows] key on your keyboard and type `cmd.exe` to start searching for the Windows Command Prompt. Hit kbd:[Enter].
1. Next type in this command
+
----
setx PATH "%PATH%;%GOPATH%\bin"
----
+
and hit kbd:[Enter].

[[troubleshooting]]
=== Troubleshooting

Problem::
* When running the `setx` command in the Command Prompt, Windows tells me this `WARNING: The data being saved is truncated to 1024 characters.`
Solution::
* Hit the kbd:[Windows] key on your keyboard and type `cmd.exe` to start searching for the Windows Command Prompt.
* Right click on the symbol and click on *Start as administrator*.
* Repeat the `setx` command that wasn't working before and add the `/M` option. This will modify the system-wide environment variable which is why you need admin rights to do this. For example: `setx /M PATH "%PATH%;%GOPATH%\bin%"`.

=== Evaluation

IMPORTANT: Before you continue, *close any existing Windows Command Prompt* (or at least close the one you've opened while working through this document). This is important because otherwise the environment variables that we have modified won't be available.

1. Hit the kbd:[Windows] key on your keyboard and type `cmd.exe` to start searching for the Windows Command Prompt. Hit kbd:[Enter].
1. Make sure we can find git, mercurial (`hg` command), glide, and go:
Execute the commands from these lines one by one
+
----
git --version
hg --version
glide --version
go version
----

1. Check that the output looks something like this:
+
----
git version 2.9.2.windows.1

----

[[install-delve]]
== Install delve

link:https://github.com/derekparker/delve[Delve] is a debugger for the Go programming language.

1. Make sure you've completed the steps in <<configure-windows-env>>.
1. Hit the kbd:[Windows] key on your keyboard and type `cmd.exe` to start searching for the Windows Command Prompt. Hit kbd:[Enter].
1. Run this command to install *delve* and make it available through the `dlv` command:
+
[source]
----
go get github.com/derekparker/delve/cmd/dlv
----

1. Test that the *dlv* command can be found by typing:
+
[source]
----
dlv version
----
+
You should see something like this:
+
[source]
----
Delve Debugger
Version: 0.11.0-alpha
Build:
----

[[get-the-code]]
== Get the code

1. Hit the kbd:[Windows] key on your keyboard and type `cmd.exe` to start searching for the Windows Command Prompt. Hit kbd:[Enter].
1. Run this command to clone the fabric8-wit project into the correct folder that we've prepared in <<create-gopath>>.
+
[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-wit.git %HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%\go\src\github.com\fabric8-services/fabric8-wit
----

[[fetch-dependencies]]
== Fetch dependencies

1. Hit the kbd:[Windows] key on your keyboard and type `cmd.exe` to start searching for the Windows Command Prompt. Hit kbd:[Enter].
1. Navigate to the source directory by running
+
[source]
----
cd %HOMEDRIVE\%HOMEPATH%\go\src\github.com\fabric8-services\fabric8-wit
----

1. Fetch the Go packages that this project depends on by running
+
[source]
----
glide install
----
+
This command could take a while to finish. After that, the dependencies are stored in `%HOMEDRIVE\%HOMEPATH%\go\src\github.com\fabric8-services\fabric8-wit\vendor`.

[[build-from-source]]
== Build from source

NOTE: Make sure that you've followed the procedures in <<get-the-code>> and <<fetch-dependencies>> before you continue.

To build the source we use the *Cygwin64 Terminal* that we've installed in <<install-cygwin>>. That terminal behaves more like a Bash on Linux than the Windows Commmand Prompt. But don't worry, this is fine.

NOTE: In the Windows Command Prompt each environment variable is accessible by typing `echo %VAR%`, whereas in the Cygwin64 Terminal we have to type `echo $VAR`. Please note, that only one prefixing character (`$`) is needed.

NOTE: Unlike the Windows Command Prompt, Cygwin64 Terminal can only handle forward slashes in paths. This is why you will see us converting our environment variables using a path converting tool, namely `cygpath`.

1. Hit the kbd:[Windows] key on your keyboard and type `cygwin` to start searching for the *Cygwin64 Terminal*. Hit kbd:[Enter].
1. Navigate to the source directory
+
[source,bash]
----
cd "$(cygpath --unix $HOMEPATH)/go/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-wit"
----

1. Now, generate code from the design templates using link:https://goa.design/[Goa]:
+
[source,bash]
----
PATH="$PATH:$(cygpath --unix "C:/Users/$USER/mercurial")" make generate
----

1. Build the the server and client component:
+
[source,bash]
----
PATH="$PATH:$(cygpath --unix "C:/Users/$USER/mercurial")" make build
----

1. Run the unit tests
+
[source,bash]
----
PATH="$PATH:$(cygpath --unix "C:/Users/$USER/mercurial")" make test-unit
----
