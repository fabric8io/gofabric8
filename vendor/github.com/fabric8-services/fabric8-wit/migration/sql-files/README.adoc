== Purpose

The purpose of this directory is to store all files that are relevant for
updating the database over time.

The SQL files themselves are packaged into the wit core binary with
link:https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata[go-bindata].

The filenames of the SQL files have no meaning but we prefix them with the
version they stand for so it is easier to find out what's happening.
The link:../migration.go[migration.go] file has the control over the
updates and the SQL files are *not* blindly executed just because they exist.
Instead we allow the developers to run Go code as well.
